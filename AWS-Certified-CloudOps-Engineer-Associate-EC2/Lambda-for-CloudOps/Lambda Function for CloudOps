Basic Lambda Function for CloudOps
Overview
This lab creates a Lambda function using Terraform that can start, stop, and list EC2 instances based on tags. This is a common CloudOps automation task for cost optimization and resource management.

Terraform Code Structure
1. Variables Configuration (variables.tf)
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
  default     = "dev"
}

variable "project_name" {
  description = "Project name"
  type        = string
  default     = "cloudops"
}

# Standard Tags
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Owner       = "Imran Shaikh"
    Project     = "Internal POC"
    DM          = "Kalpesh Kumal"
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
2. Main Infrastructure (main.tf)
Lambda Function: Python 3.9 runtime with EC2 automation code
IAM Role: Execution role with EC2 and CloudWatch permissions
CloudWatch Log Group: For function logging
3. Lambda Function Code (lambda_function.py)
Capabilities:

List Instances: Find EC2 instances by tag
Stop Instances: Stop running instances with specific tags
Start Instances: Start stopped instances with specific tags
